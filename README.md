Hi! This is my first project in c++. Pending on your choice of VS or VSC. Executable is included.

If on VSC, you will have to run the program in Administrator. As this allows the <filesystem> to work. 

This is a student management system. You can login as a student or teacher. This application creates a folder for usernames and passwords. You'll have to read to figure out how to login to become a teacher. 

Hope you enjoy my beginner code.

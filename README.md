Hi! This is my first project in c++. It's not working rn, because the running file isn't working on my system, since MSYS2 doesn't seem to wanna work. I'll figure it out and update as I go along.

If you want to run the program. You have to run it in Administrator. As this allows the <filesystem> to work. 

This is a student management system. You can login as a student or teacher. This application creates a folder for usernames and passwords. It works. I think..
